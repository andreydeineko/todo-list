Given tables: 
● tasks (id, name, status, project_id)
● projects (id, name)

1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT status
FROM tasks
ORDER BY status

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT projects.id, COUNT(tasks) AS task_count
FROM tasks RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.project_id = projects.id
GROUP BY projects.id
ORDER BY task_count DESC

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks) AS task_count
FROM tasks RIGHT JOIN projects
ON task.project_id=projects.id
GROUP BY projects.id
ORDER BY task_count

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
SELECT projects.name, task.name
FROM tasks INNER JOIN rpojects
ON tasks.project_id=projects.id
WHERE tasks.name LIKE 'N%'

5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and show the 
tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without tasks and 
tasks with project_id=NULL
SELECT projects.name, COUNT(tasks) AS task_count
FROM tasks RIGHT JOIN projects
ON task.project_id = projects.id
WHERE projects.name LIKE '%a%'
GROUP BY projects.id

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELEcT id, name
FROM tasks
WHERE name IN
(SELECT name FROM tasks GROP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) >1)
ORDER BY name

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the 
project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count
SELECT tasks.name
FROM tasks RIGHT JOIN projects
ON tasks.projects_id = projects.id
WHERE projects.name = 'Garage' 
GROUP BU tasks.name, tasks.status
HAVING COUNT(tasks) >1
ORDER BY COUNT(tasks)

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order by 
project_id
SELECt  projects.name
FROM tasks RIGTH JOIN projects
ON tasks.projects_id = projects.id
WHERE tasks.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY projects.id HAVING COUNT(tasks) >10
ORDER BY projects.id
